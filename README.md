## 8 Bit stylized OS X Screen Saver

This Xcode project is ready to be opened, built, and installed. Tested with Xcode version 8.0 on OS X El Capitan. I would expect that it'd compile for other versions OS X.

The sprite image was typed in by hand which is the same image used in my gravatar. The colors chosen are similar to Commodore 64 color pallet, and share the same index. The sprite constraints are also based on that of C64 limits.

### Install

- Open the Xcode project
- Build
- Expand the 'Products' folder
- right click on the product, 'Show in Finder'
- open the file to import it into your screen saver library
